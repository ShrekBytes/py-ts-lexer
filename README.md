# Lexical Analyzer

A fast and lightweight lexical analyzer for Python and TypeScript written in C. Extracts comments, tokenizes source code, and detects common programming errors.

## Features

- **Multi-language support** - Python (`.py`) and TypeScript (`.ts`)
- **Comment extraction** - Single-line and multi-line comments with line tracking
- **Tokenization** - Breaks code into keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and delimiters
- **Error detection** - Four types of error detection:
  - Misspelled keywords (with suggestions)
  - Type mismatches
  - Undeclared identifiers
  - Invalid operators
- **Color-coded output** - Terminal interface with syntax highlighting

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShrekBytes/py-ts-lexer.git
cd py-ts-lexer
make
```

Or compile manually:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -g -o lexer lexer.c
```

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze Python file
./lexer script.py

# Analyze TypeScript file
./lexer script.ts
```

## Error Detection Examples

**Misspelled Keywords:**
```python
pritn("Hello")  # → suggests 'print'
defn something():  # → suggests 'def'
```

**Type Mismatches:**
```python
count: int = 3.14  # → int declared, float assigned
name: str = 42     # → str declared, int assigned
```

**Undeclared Identifiers:**
```python
total = countr + 5  # → 'countr' is undeclared
```

**Invalid Operators:**
```python
if x =< 10:  # → should be '<='
if y === 5:  # → '===' not valid in Python
```

## Build Commands

```bash
make              # Build
make clean        # Clean build artifacts
make run-python   # Build and test with test.py
make run-typescript # Build and test with test.ts
```
